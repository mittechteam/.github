### ðŸ¤– Building Robots since 2007
We are a group of passionate engineers who love to build robots for the ABU Robocon Competition. Our goals are simple:
- **Participate and dominate in ABU Robocon**
- **Create a robust Robotics community in MIT-WPU**
- **Foster student-driven robotics projects and research**

At MTT we donâ€™t just build robots, we build people who build robots.
